// The colony is migrating superflat -> normal world, where miner/lumberjack/
// farmer become real gatherers. We want to STOP cheat-supplying an item once
// the colony can produce it itself, but not so early that construction stalls
// waiting for materials. So each item is tapered only when BOTH hold:
//   (1) production detected  - a producer building for the item is actively
//       working, AND
//   (2) time floor cleared   - the colony is older than N in-game days
//       (early-stall insurance).
// A tapered item gets NO primary supply; only a persistent unmet request
// (economy provably behind, STARVE_GUARD_MS) makes the safety net step back
// in. Items with no known producer are never tapered - they keep full
// gap-fill supply, which is exactly "gap-fill only for zero-production items".
//
// Production-detection PROXY = worker activity (jobStatus==="working") from
// /status, aggregated over a rolling window and mapped item->producer through
// ITEM_PRODUCER. Rationale: it is the only self-sufficiency signal available
// from existing endpoints. /warehouseStats reports rack OCCUPANCY, not per-item
// counts, so a true "warehouse stock delta per item" would need a new Java
// endpoint (out of scope here). Worker activity is the same heuristic
// work_stats.js already uses to find dead workplaces, so we reuse it verbatim.
// It is a proxy: a "working" lumberjack is assumed to be yielding its logs/
// saplings, a "working" miner its ores, etc. - true at the building-type
// granularity we taper on.
